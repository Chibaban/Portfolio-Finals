        <img class = "EB-EH" src = "Educational Background (Elem to High school).png" alt = "Educational Background (Elem to High school)" data-details = "My first and last elementary and secondary schools. I was shy at first when the class started in first grade because I didn't know anyone, but I intend to do well in school so that I can play my PSP because if I don't, I won't be able to. I believe I performed well in elementary school, earning decent grades from first to sixth grade and graduating from elementary school before moving on to high school. <br><br> My grades in high school fell from decent to poor in my seventh and tenth grades because I became so lazy at school and preferred to play video games that my parents disciplined me every time I failed to complete my assignments. As a result, I always have a school summer each year. Later on, I graduated, but only just barely, with passing grades in all of my subjects. I then made a resolution to myself that I would no longer be lazy and would complete my assignments properly.">
        <img class = "EB-SH" src = "Educational Background (Senior High School).png" alt = "Educational Background (Senior High School)" data-details = "This is my first time changing schools and I was planning to skip a year since I wasn't sure yet on the pandemic but then my parents keeps nagging me that i should continue it because it will be a wasted year if I don't. As a result I was a late enrollee at this school, but it didn't matter much because I compiled all of my documents that are required for this school. <br><br> I then remembered my pledge to myself after graduating from high school that I would no longer be lazy, so I worked on my homework and projects that I had not completed previously. I was still slow, but I was attempting to change my mindset and realized later on that I needed to pass this to avoid repeating the year, and then after the first quarter, our grades arrived on our emails. I was shocked at my grades because it skyrocketed from barely made it to high honors, It was life changing for me. After 2 years of my senior high school life, I've now graduated from this school and moving on to my college life.">
        <img class = "EB-C" src = "Educational Background (College ongoing).png" alt = "Educational Background (College ongoing)" data-details = "My first college school, where I am currently enrolled in BSIT (Bachelor of Science and Information Technology), and I am in my third year of the first semester. This is my first time confronting a subject regarding coding that I am unfamiliar with and am having difficulty adapting to, and I've noticed that some of my classmates can adapt rapidly due to their educational background from senior high schools, while others have difficulty in adapting as well. <br><br> My first year was a disaster, but I was able to adjust gradually while continuing to study other courses. Second year means something. While we have the opportunity to check other codes for reference, I am still adjusting to the new codes provided on the internet because we are limited in what we can accomplish during our first years. Third year, I can see that I'm doing well and am still learning new scripts that I can apply for my current website.">
